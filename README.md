# Bookmarked
This is a book search web app created using the [Google Books](https://developers.google.com/books/docs/v1/getting_started) API, React, and Chakra UI.

# Project Goals
The initial goal of this project was to become more confortable with REST API's in React, as well as dive deeper into using responsive stylings within Chakra UI for mobile devices.

The next steps for this project are:
- Implement a __pagination__ feature to display more results
- Implement a search resulsts __filter__
- Add a __Saved Books__ functionality, that uses local storage to save books found using the search
